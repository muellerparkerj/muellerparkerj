## Who am I?
My name is Parker Mueller. I am one of two Founders and Managing Members of Ellaton LLC. 

## Why is this GitHub so empty?
Well, you see, most of my work is done in private repo's or on private servers, avoiding the need for GitHub all together. If I have any public projects, they will be made publicly available on this GitHub and on my development platform. 

## How to reach me
You can reach me multiple ways.
